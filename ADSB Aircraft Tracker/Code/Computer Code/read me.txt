This code is designed to be ran on a computer/ raspberry pi. 
It requires an instance of dump1090 or readsb to be running and the ip address in getData to be changed to the address of that instance. 


getData - fetches the aircraft ADS-B data from either the dump1090/readsb 

targeting calculator - calculates the desired azimuth and tilt angles to point the tracker at the aircraft 

main - calls getData and targeting Calculator. Outputs the required azimuth and tilt angle to point the tracker at the closest aircraft. 


It uses the Nlohmann json library and the Simple Serial Library
