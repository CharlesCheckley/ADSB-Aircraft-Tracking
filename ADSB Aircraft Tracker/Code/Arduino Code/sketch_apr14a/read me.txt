This code is designed to work on an Arduino Nano 33 BLE. 

This code opens a serial port which then accepts the following commands 

STOP:
stops all movement 

Calibrate: 
records the tracker's current position and heading as (0,0)

Step: 
Moves the motor's a set number of steps. 
Example - Step 100 200 - moves the pan motor 100 steps and the tilt motor 200 steps

GOTO: 
moves the tracker to a specific position
Example - GOTO 10 20 - goes to 10 degrees azimuth 20 degrees tilt

get position:
outputs the current tracker's position in steps

get dposition
outputs the current tracker's position in degrees

microsteps: 
sets the microstepping of the motor drivers
Example - MICROSTEPS 16. Sets the motors to 1/16th microstepping 


By default a USB serial connection to connect to the computer. To switch to a bluetooth seria connection a  bluetooth module must be connected and the serial port used changed in the code.

Unfortunatly the Arduino Nano 33 BLE's build in bluetooth chipset cannot be used becaues it does not support a serial connection. 


This code requires the TMC stepper and Accel Stepper libraries which can be installed using the Arduino IDE
